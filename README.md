A little guide I hopefully keep up to date to help out friends and family

## Computer things

### Web Browser

As of the start of 2020 you should really be using either [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) or a Chrome dirivitive, such as [Brave](https://brave.com/) or [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/).

Google is only getting more and more sketchy over time and a few years ago they dropped their old slogan "do no evil". They have announced they will prevent or limit ad-blockers in the future. I would highly recomend you stop using Chrome and switch to an alternative. I'd recomend Firefox but you are free to do what you are comfortable with.

##### Web Browser Extensions (add-ons)

There are 3 main add-ons/extensions that you should be using if you have Firefox or stick with standard Chrome:

1. Ublock Origin [[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)] [[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm)]
2. Privacy Badger [[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/)] [[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp)]
3. HTTPS Everywhere [[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/https-everywhere/)] [[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp)]

If you use Facebook and Firefox you should use the Facebook Container. After install you will have to re-login to Facebook so be warned. This really helps to prevent FB from tracking you across the internet.

- Facebook Container [[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/)]

I can't quite *recomend* this next one but it's an extra layer of protection against tracking if you are paranoid. It's a little more use-at-your-own-risk though as it's not fully verified.

- Canvas Defender [[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-canvas-fingerprinting/)] [[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/canvas-defender/obdbgnebcljmgkoljcdddaopadkifnpm)]
